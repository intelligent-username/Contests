# Contests

![Contests](img.jpg)

## This repository contains *some* of the sources that I've used to practice DSA and coding problems. Feel free to use this as a reference

### Complete/Incomplete Status Marked at the top

#### *Note: Unmarked = complete

Effort has been made place the link/resource at the top of each file.
Each folder contains README with basic information.
This repo is mainly for storing references and progress over time.

## So Far, Includes

### UWaterloo

- CCC Junnior
- CCC Senior

With contests being ordered by year.

### LeetCode

- LC-75
- Pandas
- SQL50
- Amazon 23
- 30 Days Pandas
- 30 Days JS

### NeetCode

- A more 'beginner-friendly' version of LeetCode, structured for learning.
- This is used for review, basic foundations, and 'easy practice'

### Python-Practice

- Random Python code for practice, and OOP practice.

### HackerRank

- DSA and coding challenges.

Only includes Python so far.

### Misc

- Random stuff I thought to implement while practicing. Things like sorting algorithms, data structures, etc. from scratch. Often in Python but sometimes in C++.

New resources will be added here as I find/use them.
`*Note:` Many folders are straight up just boilerplate right now. More will be added as I continue practicing.
