# Depth First Search Problems

Problem set: [https://leetcode.com/problem-list/depth-first-search/](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/depth-first-search/)

Numbering is based on question # not order of appearance, etc.

Once I understand these, recursion problems should be easier.

Will work in Python first to get the syntax out of the way and build intuition.

Then, will start working in C++ so I can get better at C++ :)
