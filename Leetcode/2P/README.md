# Two-Pointer Problems

Basic idea is, you have some array, usually sorted. Then, you have to find some combination of elements within the array. Depending on the problem, we start with two or more pointers that either move towards each other or move at different paces in order to scan for the target(s).

Numbering is based on official problem number, not by the order of completion/list position.

This is the most basic type of pattern, usually some array + a way to keep track of multiple indices and dynamically rearrange them.
It's very essential, I need to practice this and build the intuition.
