# Miscallaneous Work Done on LeetCode

These problems aren't exactly from any specific category (or they might be but I didn't take it from there). So all files here are basically completely unorganized (just dumped). Nonetheless, they were interesting enough to solve.

I'll try to include the links

- The 'n' in file names just means "number". All files are numbered in order of completion. It's used for Java since it enforces camelCase. And for C++ since `g++`  can't compile simple numbers as file names.
- The file number will not match the question number on LeetCode. It's just the order in which I solved them.
- It's possible that I've solved some of the questions here elsewhere as well.
