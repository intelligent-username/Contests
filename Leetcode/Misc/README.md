# Miscellaneous Work Done on LeetCode

These problems aren't from any specific category. Files here are in the order that I solved their corresponding problems. Sorted by language. For many problems, I made different versions of them in different problems. I'm mainly trying to practice in `C++`.

Links included at the top.

- The 'n' in file names just means "number". All files are numbered in order of completion. It's used for Java since it enforces camelCase. And for C++ since `g++`  can't compile simple numbers as file names.
- The file number will not match the question number on LeetCode. It's just the order in which I solved them.
- It's possible that I've solved some of the questions here elsewhere as well.
