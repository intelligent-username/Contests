# Common Coding Interviews

These seem really simple, but give good ideas as to what to practice (for example, learning how to implement Timesort, with the impetus being arising from using it).

So far, the first five have been just calling the built-in sorting function. I've implemented some sorting algorithms in the Misc folder, so these can be used in place of the built-in sorting functions. They could be modified to be more like the built-in Python sort function (accept key and reverse paramters, for example).
